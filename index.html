        ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION
      </div>
      <p>
        Ancient Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BC with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first king of the First Dynasty, Narmer. Predominantly native Egyptian rule lasted until the conquest by the Achaemenid Empire in the sixth century BC.

        In 332 BC, Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered Egypt as he toppled the Achaemenids and established the short-lived Macedonian Empire, which gave rise to the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom, founded in 305 BC by one of Alexander's former generals, Ptolemy I Soter. The Ptolemies had to fight native rebellions and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its final annexation by Rome. The death of Cleopatra ended the nominal independence of Egypt, resulting in Egypt's becoming one of the provinces of the Roman Empire.

      <p>
        Egypt’s heartland, the Nile River valley and delta, was the home of one of the principal civilizations of the ancient Middle East and, like Mesopotamia farther east, was the site of one of the world’s earliest urban and literate societies. Pharaonic Egypt thrived for some 3,000 years through a series of native dynasties that were interspersed with brief periods of foreign rule. 
        
        After Alexander the Great conquered the region in 323 BCE, urban Egypt became an integral part of the Hellenistic world. Under the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty, an advanced literate society thrived in the city of Alexandria. What is now Egypt was conquered by the Romans in 30 BCE. It remained part of the Roman Republic and Empire and then part of Rome’s successor state, the Byzantine Empire, until its conquest by Arab Muslim armies in 639–642 CE.

        <h3>LANGUAGE</h3>
        <p>Arabic is currently Egypt’s official language. It came to Egypt in the 7th century. The Egyptian Arabic dialect or Masri is the official spoken language of the people. The Egyptian language, which formed a separate branch among the family of Afro-Asiatic languages, was among the first written languages and is known from the hieroglyphic inscriptions preserved on monuments and sheets of papyrus.</p>

        <h3>ANCIENT CULTURE</h3>
        <p>Ancient Egyptian Culture flourished between c. 6000 BCE with the rise of technology and 30 BCE with the death of Cleopatra VII, the last Ptolemaic ruler of Egypt. It is famous today for the great monuments which celebrated the triumphs of the rulers and honored the gods of the land.</p>

        <h3>RELIGION</h3>
        <p>Religion was an integral part of the daily life of every Egyptian. As with the people of Mesopotamia, the Egyptians considered themselves co-laborers with the gods but with an important distinction: whereas the Mesopotamian peoples believed they needed to work with their gods to prevent the recurrence of the original state of chaos, the Egyptians understood their gods to have already completed that purpose and a human’s duty was to celebrate that fact and give thanks for it.</p>

        <h3>SHAWARMA</h3>
        <p>Although shawarma is not native to Egypt originally, it has become so since Egypt was part of the Ottoman Empire. Shawarma is layers of meat which could be lamb, chicken, or beef that are placed on a spit and grilled, all day long. The outer layers are then shaved off and chucked into a tasty hunk of bread or roll. Shawarma sangas are a big highlight.</p>

        <h3>KOFTA AND KEBAB</h3>
        <p>Meat lovers, rejoice! Kofta is minced beef or lamb with plenty of spices thrown in, which is then rolled and grilled. You could call it an Egyptian-style sausage. Kebab is prepped with pieces of meat such as lamb or veal that are grilled over a coal fire on a skewer. These meat dishes are always accompanied by sides of dips, rice, bread, and veggies. This will most definitely put you in a happy food coma.</p>

        <h3>FUL MEDAMES</h3>
        <p>If ancient Egyptians and modern Egyptians have anything in common, it is Ful Medames. Ful Medames is a recipe so old and simple that it has occupied Egyptian tables for millenniums. Safe to say this is another national favourite. The dish uses entirely meat-free ingredients, including Fava beans, olive oil, and cumin and a garnish of lemon juice, onion, parsley, and cumin.</p>
